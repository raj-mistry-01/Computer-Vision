Now first we should have the students's data
We have name and roll number of the students stored in a data.csv
We will encode the each student's name(a string) into a qrcode

In main.py
    first we will read the data.csv and make a list of name and their rollnumber
    By cv2 , If a student is present it will give his or her code to camera , we will 
    decode it and by decoding it we will get his or her name after that we will remove 
    his or her name from name list
    Which names are left in list ,simple logic they are absent
